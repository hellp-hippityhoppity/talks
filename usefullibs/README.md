# Useful Libs
This is a lightning talk given at the Golang Northeast meetup in October 2018.

This contains all slides and code used in that talk. 

Note that as this was a lightning talk it is within 10minutes in length and is really a try out to see if there is interest in this topic for a longer talk. This is based on experience of using libraries. It does not cover all libraries I have used; rather those that I think are generally helpful across domains.
