#Structure Tips

This is a short talk given at golang North East in January 2019. It covers some hints, tips, and good practices
I've picked up from other people and worked out along the way.

Most of this is from a Go perspective but the ideas could be applied to any language. Where ideas are from other people 
they are attributed in the slides.
